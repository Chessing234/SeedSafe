        <h1>Product Description</h1>

        <p class="intro">SeedSafe is a prototype integrated seed storage and moisture-control system designed to reduce
            uncertainty in seed quality during post-harvest drying and storage. The system stabilises internal
            environmental conditions and makes otherwise invisible risks, such as excess humidity and thermal stress,
            visible and actionable for smallholder farmers operating in high-humidity, resource-constrained settings.
        </p>

        <p>The prototype demonstrates a passive-first, active-when-needed approach to seed preservation, combining
            moisture absorption, controlled airflow, and real-time environmental monitoring within a compact storage
            unit.</p>

        <h2>Core Functional Objective</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of SeedSafe is not high-precision measurement, but early detection and prevention of
            conditions that lead to irreversible seed viability loss. The prototype focuses on three critical parameters
            that govern seed health:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Relative humidity</li>
            <li>Temperature</li>
            <li>Moisture accumulation over time</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By monitoring and actively managing these parameters, SeedSafe enables safer storage decisions before seed
            damage occurs.</p>

        <h2>System Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>The SeedSafe prototype consists of four tightly integrated subsystems:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Environmental sensing and monitoring</li>
            <li>Passive moisture absorption (desiccant system)</li>
            <li>Active dehumidification and airflow control</li>
            <li>Control electronics and user feedback interface</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each subsystem is designed to support the others, forming a closed environmental control loop.</p>

        <h3>1. Environmental Sensing and Monitoring</h3>
        <p>The prototype uses a DHT temperature and humidity sensor positioned inside the seed storage chamber to
            continuously monitor internal environmental conditions. This sensor measures relative humidity (RH), a
            critical indicator of fungal risk and seed respiration rate, and ambient temperature, which influences
            moisture equilibrium and seed metabolism.</p>
        <p>Sensor data is processed by an Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller, which serves as the central control unit for
            the system. Rather than collecting excessive data, the system prioritizes stable, interpretable readings
            that can be acted upon in real time.</p>
        <p>A 16×2 LCD display provides immediate visual feedback, displaying current temperature and humidity values.
            This ensures the system remains accessible without reliance on smartphones, apps, or internet connectivity.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Passive Moisture Absorption System (Desiccant Layer)</h3>
        <p>To minimize energy use and maintain environmental stability, SeedSafe employs a passive desiccant-based
            moisture control system as its first line of defense.</p>
        <p>Silica gel beads are embedded along the side walls of the storage chamber. These beads absorb excess moisture
            from the surrounding air, lower relative humidity without electrical power, and reduce humidity spikes
            during nighttime or high-humidity conditions.</p>
        <p>This side-mounted configuration increases the effective surface area for moisture absorption while keeping
            desiccants physically separated from the stored seeds, preventing contamination.</p>

        <h3>3. Active Dehumidification System (Peltier-Based)</h3>
        <p>When passive desiccation alone is insufficient, such as during prolonged high-humidity conditions, the
            prototype activates an active dehumidification system. This system uses one Peltier thermoelectric module to
            create a temperature differential, a heat sink to dissipate excess heat from the hot side of the Peltier,
            and two fans to manage airflow and heat exchange.</p>
        <p>As humid air passes over the cooled surface of the Peltier module, moisture condenses and is removed from the
            internal air. The fans ensure even air circulation throughout the chamber, preventing localised moisture
            buildup and maintaining uniform conditions.</p>
        <p>This active system is designed to operate intermittently, only when humidity thresholds are exceeded,
            preserving energy efficiency.</p>

        <h3>4. Air Circulation and Thermal Management</h3>
        <p>Controlled airflow is essential for both moisture removal and temperature stability. The prototype
            incorporates two axial fans positioned to create continuous internal air circulation, directed airflow paths
            that move air past desiccant surfaces and the Peltier cooling zone, and a heat sink to prevent heat
            accumulation that could damage seeds.</p>
        <p>This configuration ensures that drying and dehumidification occur evenly, avoiding hotspots or overdrying
            zones that could compromise seed viability.</p>

        <h2>Control Logic and System Behavior</h2>
        <p>The Arduino Pro Mini continuously reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT sensor. When relative
            humidity exceeds predefined thresholds, the system activates the Peltier module and fans to reduce moisture
            levels. Once conditions return to a safe range, the system reverts to passive moisture control using the
            silica desiccant layer.</p>
        <p>This feedback-driven control loop allows the system to maintain stable conditions over time, rather than
            reacting only after damage has occurred.</p>

        <h2>Design Philosophy and Constraints</h2>
        <p>The SeedSafe prototype is intentionally designed with minimal electronics, readable local feedback (LCD
            display), modular components for future iteration, and compatibility with solar power integration in later
            versions.</p>
        <p>The design avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing instead on reliability, interpretability, and integration
            into existing agricultural workflows.</p>

        <h2>What This Prototype Demonstrates</h2>
        <p>This prototype successfully demonstrates that internal seed storage humidity can be actively and passively
            controlled, environmental risks can be made visible to users in real time, and a low-cost, modular system
            can stabilize seed storage conditions without laboratory infrastructure.</p>
        <p>While this version does not directly measure germination or pathogens, it addresses the root environmental
            drivers of seed degradation, forming a foundation for future biological validation and decision-state
            modeling.</p>

        <h2>Alignment with Long-Term Vision</h2>
        <p>This prototype represents the first functional step toward SeedSafe's broader vision: a decision-support seed
            storage system that converts environmental signals into actionable guidance for farmers. Future iterations
            will focus on solar-powered operation, improved thermal storage, simplified decision-state indicators, and
            field validation with specific seed types.</p>
